Final Project Proposal - Mafia

Description of the Project
For this project, we want to create a Mafia game. The rules are in the README


Description of User Interface
The user interface will entirely take place in the terminal. Any action a user needs to take, as a member of the mafia or a 
civilian, will be conducted by instructions through the terminal. The game will not progress without each user taking the 
necessary action.  The terminal will allow players to conduct voting (choosing victims at night, and removing players 
during the day).


Description of the Technical Design
Each game will have its own server. During setup, the user will input to the server the number of players. The server will then
wait for players to wait for all users to signal they are ready to start. Afterwards, once the game starts, the server
will have a night and day function.  The night function will detect any user input. At night, the mafia members are prompted to enter who they want to kill.During the day, the server will run a similar process, instead checking for chat messages to 
all members, or if a vote is being placed to remove a player.  If a player receives a majority vote against them, they will be 
removed and placed into spectate mode. The server will run checks in the beginning/end of the day/night cycle to see if a side has won the game yet. The project will use the topics of: allocating memory, working with files, processes, 
pipes, shared memory, semaphores, and networking.
