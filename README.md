Rise of the Mafia

Team Members:
Stefan Tan, Reed Scheinberg, Dahong Jiang

Class Period:

Description:
In a peaceful town, a mysterious mafia found a way to blend in among the happy citizens.
No one knew of this arrival until the clock struck midnight. A scream raced through the streets,
followed by utter silence. The next morning, a citizen lay dead. The mafia has struck. It is up
to the people of the town to eliminate the mafia, through the crude system of votes and
execution. Whether or not the citizens have made the right choice will be signaled by what they
see in the morning; another body or clear tranquility. You will play your part in this story
and your decisions will mark your fate.
